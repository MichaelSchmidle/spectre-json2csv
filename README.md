# Spectre JSON to CSV Converter

The script spectre-json2csv.py converts—as its name suggests—JSON files provided by [Spectre](https://www.saltedge.com/products/spectre) to simple CSV files. Any JSON file found in the subfolder ``json`` will be converted into a CSV file in the ``csv`` subfolder.

For convenience, a docker-compose file is included to run the script in a suitable Python environment.
